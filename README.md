# 🛢️ Oil Spill Dataset: Analysis & Classification Modeling Report

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset comprises **937 rows and 48 columns**, with the objective of predicting oil spills. The **target variable (`Target`)** is binary (0 or 1), indicating whether an oil spill occurred. The dataset includes a mix of numerical and categorical variables.

### ✅ Key Characteristics:
- **Target Type**: Binary classification (0 or 1)
- **No Missing Values**: Dataset is complete
- **Class Imbalance**: Present — addressed with **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

1. **Column Renaming**: All columns were renamed to `col_0` through `col_49` for clarity.
2. **Target Separation**: The `Target` column was isolated from the features.
3. **Feature Scaling**: All features were scaled using **StandardScaler**.
4. **Imbalance Correction**: SMOTE was applied to balance the class distribution and improve model performance.

  - Best: **89.36%** using `n_neighbors=10`, `algorithm='brute'`

### 3. **Decision Tree**
- Two splits evaluated:
  - Best: **94.68%** using `criterion='gini'`

### 4. **Random Forest**
- Estimators and criteria varied:
  - Best: **95.74%** with `n_estimators=150`, `criterion='entropy'`
